To create a new domain-subdir just copy the _DOMAIN directory and rename to the new domain-name.
E.g. copy "_DOMAIN" to "greenland" and the address ifm.fcoo.dk/greenland/index.html will be redirected to ifm.fcoo.dk/index.html#domain=greenland
All parametre and hash-tages are transfered to the new page
